## Introduction

This repository is aimed at practicing and implementing various data structures and algorithms using Python. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the core principles of computer science, such as searching, sorting, tree structures, graph traversal, dynamic programming, etc., with hands-on code examples.

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.13
- **Libraries**: None required (all implementations are written using basic Python constructs)

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:
